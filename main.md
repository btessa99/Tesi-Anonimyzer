# RECOGNITION AND ANONYMYZATION OF GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES USING MICROSOFT PRESIDIO


The goal of this project is to :

1. Recognize geographic coordinates in text files.
2. Anonimyze them through specific functions

This was possible by extending the analyzer and anonimyzer modules of [Microsoft Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio).

In the following folders you can find more information about the set up and the implementation:

- Analyzer
- [Anonimyzer](https://github.com/btessa99/Tesi-Anonimyzer/blob/main/documentation_tessa.md)
