# RECOGNITION AND ANONIMYZATION OF GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES USING MICROSOFT PRESIDIO


The goal of this project is to :

1. Recognize geographic coordinates in text files.
2. Anonimyze them through specific functions

This was possible by extending the Analyzer and Anonimyzer modules of [Microsoft Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio).

In the following folders you can find the classes used for the extention :

- [Analyzer](https://github.com/btessa99/Tesi-Anonimyzer/blob/main/analyzer/analyzer.md)
- [Anonymizer](https://github.com/btessa99/Tesi-Anonymizer/blob/main/anonymizer/anonymizer.md)
